Comment: The generator actually works great! I think it was a pretty unique way of doing it too. It looks nice, just the blue was a little hard for me to read. Theres not too much for me to say about this, you're doing a great job!

You are to build out a Random Name Generator.

Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors.

You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.
Don't forget to have fun!!!
